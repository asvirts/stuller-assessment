 Assessment for employment with Stuller.
 
 - Written in VSCode and connected through GitHub Desktop
 - Utilizes HTML/CSS with Bootstrap
 - Google Fonts used for fonts
 - Social media icons are pulled from the provided PSD documents
 - Page should be responsive across different screen sizes
 - Assets are organized neatly
 - Links on pages do not go anywhere intentionally (except social media icons where I linked to Stuller's pages just as an example), only there to represent link implementation and functionality
